# Daily Schedule

Sometimes people become lazy and not willing to approaching their planned lofty goal. It might be because of not being in the mood, feel frustrating, dumped by someone. Anyway, We should not stop struggling. With a daily schedule tool's help, we can make use of every minute and squeeze the last drop of our blood, sweat, and tears.

# Why not choose a calendar?

A calendar is for some special event like my boss will talk to me tomorrow morning. My girlfriend's birthday is next month, and I don't want to sleep at night with only my hands in the following months, so I better remember the exact day and buy something meaningful or valuable for her.

A daily scheduler focuses on how we can live every moment, balance life and busywork. Some doctors say living a regular life is good for health; I'm afraid I disagree with them, but I have no proof. That's sad. 

Anyway, I like all my things well organized, not only significant but also trivial; this is why.

# How to make a contribution

-   Generally, using this software is support.
-   Or a pull request for some bug fix or new feature is even better. Filing bugs, providing a translation, Polish document, introducing to the public, or giving us advice. They all are welcome!
-   If you think this software is of any help and don't have time to do the above, How about buying me a coffee to cheer me up?
